# GIS 311 Class Notes

This repo has all the notes that will be used in the GIS 311 class. The notes will consist of intructions and tips on how to complete the practicals and assignments but not step by step instructions on what to do. This module requires a higher level of thinking so feel welcome to think out of the box. 

Any issues or comments with this repo, please feel feel to contact [Victoria Rautenbach](https://github.com/vrautenbach) or [Cameron Green](https://github.com/CamGreen) or create an issue.
