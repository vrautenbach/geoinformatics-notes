# Getting started with web mapping libraries

## Overview

There is a wide range of web mapping libraries available. It is important to know that not all web mapping libraries are equal, you have to read the documents and review the functionalities before deciding on the best library for your purposes.

[Sitepen](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/how-to-pick-a-web-mapping-library-for-your-app) put together a list of things to look at:

* What geospatial functionality is required? Map tiles? Address lookups? Editing polygons? Satellite imagery?
* Do we have in house services for these features, or do I need third party services?
* Will the license agreement of a library/service match my business model?
* Is the pricing prohibitively expensive for the value this would add to the app?
* What are the additional complexities and increases in developer time added by including a mapping segment to the app?
