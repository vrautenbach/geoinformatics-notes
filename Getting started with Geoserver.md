# Overview 
[GeoServer](http://geoserver.org) is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards. GeoServer is the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards, as well as a high performance certified compliant Web Map Service (WMS). GeoServer forms a core component of the Geospatial Web.

# Web Map Service and Web Feature Service
Web services are independent, modular applications that can be published, located and dynamically invoked across the web.

A web service is a program created with a specific purpose and to be able to use the web service, the user requires little to no knowledge about the implementation of the web service, but must be familiar with the interface. 

The two main web services that you will use is web map service (WMS) and web feature service (WFS). WMS is used to generate an image of your data, whereas WFS is used to access the actual data. Below is examples of both WMS and WFS.
