## What is Open Data?

### Overview

According to [The Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/), Open Data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.

This can be extended to focus on the following point:

* **Availability and Access**: the data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.
* **Re-use and Redistribution**: the data must be provided under terms that permit re-use and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets.
* **Universal Participation**: everyone must be able to use, re-use and redistribute - there should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, ‘non-commercial’ restrictions that would prevent ‘commercial’ use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes \(e.g. only in education\), are not allowed.

### Additional reources

If you want to learn more, have a look at the [European Unions 5 min course on open data](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/elearning/en/module1/#/id/co-01). This mini-course will show you how governments, businesses and individuals can use open data to bring about social, economic and environmental benefits.
