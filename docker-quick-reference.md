# Docker quick reference

## Overview

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an open source containerization platform. It provides the ability to run applications in an isolated environment known as a container.

Containers are like very lightweight virtual machines that can run directly on our host operating system's kernel without the need of a hypervisor. As a result we can run multiple containers simultaneously.
